Pete's OpenGL2 ARB program shader effect: "Multi tex demo"
==========================================================

Description:
------------
Simple ARB shader for demonstrating how to use multiple texture units in an ARB program shader. It will just mix a PITECH-sign with the current psx display.


Installation:
-------------
Copy the "gpuPeteOGL2.vp", "gpuPeteOGL2.fp" and "gpuPeteOGL2_t1n.tga" files into a emu sub-directory called "shaders" (or make a new folder whereever you like it). Configure the plugin's "Shader effects" option to "3 - ARB program files". If you are using a special folder, don't forget to set it in the plugin config a well (by using the "..." button).

The "Shader effect level" option will do nothing with this shader.
