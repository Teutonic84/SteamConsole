Pete's OpenGL2 ARB program shader effect: "Pseudo Median + Luminance" - Coded by Renee Cousins
==============================================================================================

Description:
------------
Pseudo Median shader + Luminance - by Renee Cousins. 

Quoting Renee: "I wanted a  median filter - but couldn't (since even a 3x3 median 
needs too many samples) -  and found a compromise. When used in addition to the 
normal blur (not to be used in place of.), it significantly improves the display 
and makes it somewhat more "vibrant" though that's purely subjective. The nice thing, 
is that unlike the Scale2x, this doesn't take a Radeon9700 to run ;)"

Small hint: you can edit the ".fp" text file, to control how strong the glowing
should become.


Installation:
-------------
Copy the "gpuPeteOGL2.vp" and "gpuPeteOGL2.fp" files into a emu sub-directory called "shaders". Configure the plugin's "Shader effects" option to "3 - ARB program files". The "Shader effect level" option will control how strong the effect will be done. The OGL2 plugin's "full screen filter" option should be activated as well.
