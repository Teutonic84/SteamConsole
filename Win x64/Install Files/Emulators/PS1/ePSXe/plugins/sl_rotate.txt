Pete's OpenGL2 GLslang shader effect: "Rotate"
==============================================

Description:
------------
A shader for rotating the screen in 90° steps. Can be useful in certain psx games which allow screen rotation as well (like "Raiden Project").

Installation:
-------------
Copy the "gpuPeteOGL2.slv" and "gpuPeteOGL2.slf" files into a emu sub-directory called "shaders". Configure the plugin's "Shader effects" option to "5 - GLSlang files". The "Shader effect level" option is controlling the angle:

Level 1: 0°
Level 2: 90°
Level 3: 180°
Level 4: 270°

To get a better aspect ratio in 90°/270°, the "Keep psx aspect ratio" option of the plugin should be activated as well.
