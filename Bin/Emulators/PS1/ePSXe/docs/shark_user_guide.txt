There's been lots of fixes to ePSXe. So here's the basic overview of what you can change.



PAD config
1- Run ePSXe_shark_padconfig
2- Choose input plugins
3- Run ePSXe and start game



inis\\ePSXE_shark.ini

delay_injection
- This is the amount of time before the DLL hack starts. Set this to a higher
  value if running ePSXe_shark.exe doesn't start ePSXe.exe



timer_precise
- Sets the Win32 timer to use 1ms granularity (recommended)



fast_start
- When you start a game, uses fast-forward to speed up the in-game boot time



autorun
- Lets you quick-start the last game played

1 = Ask to start CDROM
2 = AUto-start CDROM

3 = Lets you select ISO game every time
4 = Ask to start last ISO
5 = Auto-start last ISO



throttle_fps_off
- Pressing F4 will let you limit the speed (ex. 180 if you want a certain speed limit)



max_fps_key
- Press this key to turn off all framelimiting (if F4 doesn't work)

see inis\\vk_list.txt for replacement keys



shark_cheater
- A built-in PEC-style cheater replacement

see shark_codelist_archive for examples



autostart_controllers
- When using ePSXe controllers, lets you auto-select the device

1 = auto-select mouse, negcon, guncon devices
2 = auto-start dualshock / dualanalog controller


ex. mouse / digital ==> mouse is on by default
ex. dualshock ==> sets analog mode by default



dvd5_mode
- Lets you use special shalma's disc combining kits (@ ngemu)

ex. FF 8/9, Fear Effect 1/2



disable_memcards
- Lets you disable all memcards

1 = disable both ports

ex. Lifeforce Tenka boot


NOTE:
If you set the memcard file to 'none', it will keep the memcard ejected
(ex. Lifeforce Tenka boot)



mouse_sensitive
- Lets you set the sensitivity of the ePSXe mouse



guncon_sensitive
- Lets you set the sensitivity of the ePSXe guncon



show_cursor

2 1 ~ 5 apu
4 2 ~ 11 apu
8 3 ~ 22 apu
16 4 ~ 44 apu
32 5 ~ 89 apu (default)
64 6 ~ 179 apu (faster speed)

1 0 = run spu every 2 apu cycles (set this value in DSound expert ini)



dualshock_mouse
- Special emulation that lets you simulate a dualshock controller using a
  keyboard + mouse



dualshock_mouse_ini
- Currently only Ape Escape config is supported



negcon_ini
- Lets you customize the deadzone of Negcon device (partly working)



opcode_tracer

1 = Press F11 to start
2 = Auto-start at tracing address
3 = Freeze r3000 at address (press F11 to start)


ex.
2 80010000 ==> start tracing @ $80010000



cdrom_tracer
- Turns on cdrom debugging logs (dynarec or interpreter) (Press F11)



analog_deadzone_left
- Lets you specify ePSXe dualshock deadzones for P1 analog-left



analog_deadzone_right
- Lets you specify ePSXe dualshock deadzones for P1 analog-right



konami_justifier1
konami_justifier2
- Unsupported



mousewheel_converter
- Hack that lets the ePSXe mouse behave as a USB mouse (3-button + wheel)
(only works with games that are hacked to use this mode)
