# SteamConsole
SteamConsole turns your PC into a console-like interface using Steam big picture mode and some free third party tools. This allows you to use your controller as a mouse/keyboard as well as import old school video game ROMS into steam to play.

Things To Note:
The 32-bit version will not be able to play gamecube, wii or psp ROMs. This is because the emulators for those consoles do not support 32-bit.
