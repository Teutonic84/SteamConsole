#SteamConsole
SteamConsole turns your PC into a console-like interface using Steam big picture mode and some free third party tools. This allows you to use your controller as a mouse/keyboard as well as import old school video game ROMS into steam to play.

##Things To Note:

* The 32-bit version will not be able to play gamecube, wii or psp ROMs. This is because the emulators for those consoles do not support 32-bit.
* Currently only Xinput (Xbox) controllers are supported out of the box. You can use Dualshock 3 & 4 controllers with this, but you will need to manually setup one of the DS Tools out there that converts Dualshock input into Xinput. I have included "DS4Tool" for DS4 only and "DSTool-Reloaded" for both DS3 & DS4 controllers. They are located in "..\SteamConsole\Tools\". Below are links to both of the DS Tool project pages.
