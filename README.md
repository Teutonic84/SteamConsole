#SteamConsole
SteamConsole turns your PC into a console-like interface using Steam big picture mode and some free third party tools. This allows you to use your controller as a mouse/keyboard as well as import old school video game ROMS into steam to play.

##Things To Note:

* The 32-bit version is no longer supported. It is not able to play gamecube, wii or psp ROMs. This is because the emulators for those consoles do not support 32-bit. So this was one of many reasons why 32-bit support was dropped.
* Currently only Xinput (Xbox) controllers are supported out of the box. You can use Dualshock 3 & 4 controllers with this, but you will need to select the custom install option and check the box for "DS3 & DS4". Below is a link to the DSTool reloaded project page that SteamConsole uses.
