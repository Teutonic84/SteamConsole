#
# Specifies the emulators that Ice can use when supporting consoles. Each
# can be referenced (by name) in consoles.txt to tell Ice how to launch games.
#
# Before attempting to add a new emulator on your own, check
# http://scottrice.github.io/Ice/emulators to see if someone has already found
# a configuration that works for your emulator.
#
# To add a new emulator manually, make a new entry using the following format:
#
# [*Emulator name*]
# location=*path to the emulator .exe file*
# command=*optional, command to use to launch a game*
#
# The 'command' option is not necessary, and the default should work for most
# emulators. If it does not, go to http://scottrice.github.io/Ice/faq to learn
# how to set up your emulator.
#
# Example Windows Configuration
